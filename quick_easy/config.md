During revision, this add-on puts the focus on the 'Easy' answer button or 'Hard' answer buttons depending on how quickly or slowly you answer.
Change the `secondsEasy` variable to adjust the timing for when to default to easy; Change the 'secondsHard" variable to adjust the timing for when to default to hard.

Change the timeout variable to set a max time to consider either easy or hard. This is helpful for when you leave Anki open and come back later, but don't want it to default to hard.
